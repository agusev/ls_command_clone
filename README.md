 # ft_ls

## My own ls command written on C

## How to compile? 
 
 use "make"

## How to run?

 use this like regular ls. "./ft_ls"
 
### The following options are available:

        -l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)
            If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all
            the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

        -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

        -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

        -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
            order or the oldest entries first or largest files last, if combined with sort by size.

        -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

        -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per line.
            This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

        -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.

        -T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell'') option,
            display complete time information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute, second, and year.
